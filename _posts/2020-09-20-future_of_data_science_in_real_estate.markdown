Data has always been used to analyze real estate investment opportunities. There are many tools to help understand the vast amounts of information in the industry. However, family members in the commercial real estate space,  have emphasized how far behind technologically the industry is. Data science can help in this regard.
<br>
One of the main issues facing the industry is how compartmentalized the data tends to be.  There is no national database that data scientist can draw from. It's typically sectioned off by state and even more by county. This creates an issue with quality, normalcy, and accessibility.  Traditionally, data was used for transactions and property value determination. But, with an increase of data collection more can be done to increase investment confidence and accuracy. 
<br>
Mitigating risk by incorporating he myriad of data available will in turn increase the overall return on investment. Everything from school rating, crime rate, flood maps, demographics information, retail proximity, walk-ability gives more accurate insight into investment opportunities. Merging both physical attributes as well as human components of properties generates more accurate assessments to investors that creates confidence to take action on investment properties.
<br>
With this wealth of knowledge comes an acceleration in decision making all by leveraging data analytics to speed up the due diligence process. In turn, allowing the investment to 'go live' and start generating income much more quickly.
<br>
Both individual and institutional investors could profit from a platform with a comprehensive dataset to analyze for future investments. Having the ability to quickly parse through swaths of information would greatly impact risk and increase investing confidence of any size investor. One feature that comes to mind would be mapping capabilities to visualize any number of parameters. This could generate 'heat maps' for zeroing in on specific investment opportunities on both small and large scales. Having this type of powerful tool will increase investing confidence, generate unforeseen investment opportunities, but also generate more competition within the real estate industry.
