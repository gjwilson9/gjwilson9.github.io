Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that use various models to autonomously learn from data while improving performance and accuracy to a specific task at hand. Machine learning is designed so that algorithms can improve as more data are provided. Most applications today are in the form of applied AI which replicates some form of human intelligence for a specific purpose. 
<br>
Origins of machine learning can be traced back to the 1950's when a data scientist named Arthur Lee Samuel taught an IBM computer program to learn the game of checkers, and subsequently improve its game play the more it played. Many new concepts were introduced in the following decades. And in 1986, Rina Dechter developed a deep learning technique based on artificial neural networks which was a major advancement for the machine learning community. However, during the 1990's is really when the data driven approach rose in popularity. With the ever increasing addition of more computing power these techniques have become a part of every day use from a personal user to large business operations.

As for the oil and gas industry, there are vast amounts of opportunities to implement ML into daily operations. The use of AI for exploration and production companies could  allow for optimizing well design, drilling and completion best practices, or even performing dangerous tasks to decrease human risk and error. It could also improve production rates, lower operating cost, and troubleshoot under performing assets.
<br>
The amount of data that engineers and geologists use on a daily basis is staggering. Using AI would help with enhancing reservoir modeling while de-risking future drill targets by optimizing target locations.
<br>
On the land side of companies, it would streamline the asset acquisition process by decreasing the time it takes to scour public records, land and production data for pertinent information.
<br>
AI can be, and is, used for oil futures contracts price predictions. This helps with achieving maximum efficiency when negotiating contracts and hedging future production. 
<br>
Companies who adopt these practices will see a monetary advantage in streamlining arduous tasks through AI as well as gain a significant competitive advantage over companies who will be slow to adopt the new paradigm in the future.
