Having worked in the oil and gas as an exploration geologist for the past eight years, I've got a vested interest in integrating data science and geology within relevant industries. Although, I haven't specifically worked in the mining industry, I've had a passion for understanding both the operational and financial aspects of the mining sector ever since I began heavily investing precious metals equities back in 2012. Because of this, I'd like to take a look at how data science can be benefitially implemented into all aspects of the mining process.
<br>
Mining is a notoriously clunky operation as it requires tons of slow-moving, heavy machinery throughout every step of the process. So, imporoving efficiency and prodiuctivity can be quite crutial to profitability. Improvements in areas like product yeild, mining speed and efficiency can make huge impacts across the board. This would not only have an impact on daily operations of mining, but also indirectly on opther indutries that are reliant on raw materials provided through the mining process.

Rio Tinto, a top tier major producer within the industry, has already begun to implement data science in the form of autonomy, machine learning, and robotics into its mining operations. For example, ten years ago they successfully began using fully autonomous haul trucks; this has reduced fiel costs by 13% while increasing safety. They've also begun using autonomous loaders and driling systems that have improved productivity by around 10%. Now, they collects data every minute from all of their mobile equipment and sensors and transmit data in real time to help with monitoring equipment in use. This is just on the operations and production side of the equation; data science can also be used by geologists and engineers for mineral exploration.

Machine learning can help digest the massive amounts of subsurface data that geologists work with on a day to day basis by improving precision on prospect generation, ore body development and boundary recognition, as well as concentration accuracy. These machine learning efforts would definitely help the mining industry decrease human error while making companies more profitable for themselves and share holders.

The shear volume of material that needs to be sorted and removed before finding valuable metals is astronomical. Machine learning algorithms are being developed by way of 'smart sorting machines' that help with recognition and sorting of useless rock waste from the valuable ore bodies. Based on the material being mined, the company can customize their machines to recognize for the specific metals being mined.
<br>
One of the most important ways data science can contribute to the mining industry is through increased safety. Mining is historically a risky business, especially if mining is occuring deep underground. Thanks to real time data monitoring, equipment can be maintained before it breaks down. Senors can monitor temperature, speed, vibration on machines to make sure preventative action is taken before a disaster can occur.

The true benefits of data science in the mining industry are just starting to be recognized, but they will help with overall safety, efficiency, accuracy, precision which all lead to profitability for the company and its share holders.
